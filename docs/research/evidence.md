# Rebuild evidence log

Measurements taken while planning the rebuild (2026-10-06 onward). Each entry: question, method, result, implication.

## E1. Is the h128 outcome head a predictor of the best play we have?
- **Method:** `target/rebuild/calib_start.py`. First 600 fights of `data/train/eval.json` (5 characters, 3 acts, A10).
  - Predicted P(win) at fight start: the h128 outcome head (`1 - P(class 0)`), averaged over 8 opening shuffles.
  - Realized win rate, 8 attempts per fight, under two kinds of play:
    - greedy h128;
    - search at 3x8 with h128 as the only evaluator (depth 2).
- **Result:**

| play | win | predicted | bias | pred 0.2-0.4 → actual | 0.4-0.6 → | 0.6-0.8 → |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| greedy | 0.664 | 0.663 | -0.001 | 0.31 | 0.59 | 0.70 |
| search 3x8 | 0.728 | 0.663 | -0.065 | 0.49 | 0.73 | 0.88 |

- **Implication:** the head predicts the raw policy, not search play.
  - It underestimates search outcomes by 19-23 points in the 0.2-0.8 band, where macro decisions turn.
  - Any macro pricing built on it would be pessimistic and would mis-rank risky fights.
  - The foundation predictor must be trained on outcomes under the play it is supposed to predict, through search distillation or expert iteration.
  - The search's gain is concentrated in mid-probability fights.

## E2. Knowledge Demon at 0%: is it the deck or the solver?
- **Method:** `eval --boss --hp 70 --attempts 128` from the playtest run, at the Act 2 start: Silent with Velvet Choker, a 21-card Act 1 deck, a Flex Potion.
- **Result:**

| deck | win |
|---|---|
| deck as played | 0.00 |
| + poison engine (Noxious Fumes, Accelerant, 2x Bouncing Flask, Afterimage, Malaise; -3 Strike, -2 Defend) | 1.00 (HP lost 29%) |
| + power scaling (2x Noxious Fumes, Accelerant, Afterimage, Footwork, Well-Laid Plans, Burst, Corrosive Wave; -6 basics) | 0.98 |
| + shiv package | 0.22 |

- **Implication:**
  - The solver can win this boss, so the 0% is the deck.
  - Greedy pricing of single picks sees no gradient this far from the threshold. Target decks proposed by the operator and tested by the predictor do.
  - The run model should price progress toward a chosen plan, for example P(the deck reaches the plan before the boss).
